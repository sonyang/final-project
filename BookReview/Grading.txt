database schema                           Have no complaints at all. Database is short, efficient and all keys are in the proper place
book cover art                  +75 pts   All covers were in place and stored correctly in database.
book/index.cshtml     line 29   -5 pts    id attributes must be unique for each object. This is not valid html
book/details.cshtml             -5 pts    use of overflow on the reviews items makes reviews hard to read, regular browser scrolling would have worked.
home/index.cshtml               -10 pts   use of carousel was almost a hit aside from the fact in bootstrap you must include the js calls for it. ( Not fully implemented )
BookController.cs               -30 pts   missed some vital calls to check to see if the user could run actions. No authentications checks
ReviewController.cs             -40 pts   missed authentication items, such as user can't edit other user's reviews, admin's can adminster all, etc...

I would like to say all in all a great job to each and everyone of you. For as timid and quiet as a group you all were, you buckled down, put in extra hours and 
completed this project. A web application is a very difficult project as it lumps many concepts together to create a single programming user experience. This being said
I am very proud the way you conducted the team environment, utlized your resources, and managed through trouble times and found resolutions. Programming is not only about 
the ability to mash out code, but mostly attitude, concept, and desire. Thank you all for a good semester and a worthy final project.
